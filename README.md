### General Plan
Building a screenless smart watch with accurate health detection. I would love for the open source community to help develop the data algorithms to improve sleep and excercize monitoring once developed.

I plan to make it have the option between being screenless and e-ink so it has a long battery. It will not have notifications or anything non health/time related (except maybe a map).


### Tools
- FreeCAD
- KiCAD

### Hardware Plan

Sensors
- PPG Sensor (e.g., MAX30102). Must include HR, HRV, and Sp0<sub>2</sub>. 
- Temperature Sensor.
- Motion
  - accelerometer,
  - gryo,
  - IMU,
  - GPS


Remaining Prototype Parts
- Bluetooth
- Vibration

Final Product
- Use "advanced nanoguard" spray to waterproof the circuit board.
